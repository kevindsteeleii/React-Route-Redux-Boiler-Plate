# React-Router/Redux Boilerplate v 1.2
Repo using webpack to create a handy boilerplate for a React/Router/Redux app.

## Build Notes:
The webpack config and package.json is configured with a few things in mind:
  * SASS pre-processor & CSS style sheets
  * static files
  * ES5+
  * JSX
  * Typescript
  * React, Router & Redux
  * Linting
  * Testing (MochaJS)
